# Viewflow Backend Directory Structure

This document describes the files and directories within the backend directory.

## Top-Level Files

* **`.editorconfig`**: Configuration file for editor settings (e.g., indentation, end-of-line characters). Ensures consistent code formatting across different editors.
* **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories to exclude from Git version control. Typically includes temporary files, build artifacts, and sensitive information.
* **`CHANGELOG.rst`**: A changelog file documenting changes made to the project over time. Follows reStructuredText format.
* **`COMM-LICENSE`**: Likely contains the commercial license information for this project.
* **`implementation.md`**: A markdown file detailing the implementation details of the backend.
* **`LICENSE`**: The main license file for the project, specifying the terms of use and distribution.
* **`LICENSE_EXCEPTION`**: Likely contains exceptions or additions to the main license.
* **`LICENSE.django`**: License file specifically related to Django components or usage within the project.
* **`manage.py`**: Django's command-line utility for managing the project (e.g., running the server, creating migrations).
* **`MANIFEST.in`**: Specifies files to include in the source distribution. Used by setuptools during packaging.
* **`package-lock.json`**: Stores the exact versions of all project dependencies, ensuring consistent builds. Generated by npm.
* **`package.json`**: Specifies project metadata, dependencies, and scripts. Used by npm for package management.
* **`README.md`**: The main README file providing an overview of the project.
* **`setup.cfg`**: Configuration file for setuptools, used for building and installing the project.
* **`setup.py`**: The main setup script for the project, defining metadata and build instructions.
* **`tox.ini`**: Configuration file for tox, a virtual environment management and testing tool.
* **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript compiler configuration file. Specifies compiler options and project settings.
* **`tsconfig.node.json`**: TypeScript compiler configuration file specifically for Node.js environment.
* **`vite.config.mts`**: Vite configuration file (likely for frontend build).

## Subdirectories

* **`assets/`**: Contains static assets such as images and icons used in the application.
* **`demo/`**: Likely contains a demo application or example usage of the backend.
* **`tests/`**: Contains unit and integration tests for the backend code. Organized by feature or module.
* **`viewflow/`**: The core Viewflow application code. This directory likely contains the main application logic, models, views, and other components.  Further analysis of this directory would require additional tool calls.


This README provides a high-level overview. Detailed analysis of individual files and subdirectories follows below.

## Subdirectory Details

### `assets/`

This directory contains static assets used by the application.  Files include images (`*.png`, `*.svg`, `*.gif`) for various UI elements.

### `demo/`

This directory likely contains a sample application demonstrating the use of the Viewflow backend.  Further investigation is needed to determine the exact functionality.

### `tests/`

This directory houses the test suite for the backend.  It's organized into subdirectories by feature (e.g., `components`, `fsm`, `workflow`).  Each subdirectory contains Python test files (`*.py`) using a testing framework (likely pytest).  The tests cover various aspects of the backend, including models, views, forms, and workflow logic.

### `viewflow/`

This is the core Viewflow application code.  It contains modules for:

* **`apps.py`**: Django app configuration.
* **`conf.py`**: Viewflow configuration settings.
* **`fields.py`**: Custom Django fields for Viewflow.
* **`jsonstore.py`**: JSON data storage for Viewflow.
* **`middleware.py`**: Middleware for Viewflow integration.
* **`this_object.py`**: Utility functions related to accessing the current object.
* **`utils.py`**: General utility functions for Viewflow.
* **`components/`**: UI components (likely using a framework like React or Vue).
* **`apps.py`**: Defines the `ViewflowConfig` class, a Django app configuration class.
* **`conf.py`**: Defines the `Settings` class for managing Viewflow configuration, allowing for customization via `django_settings.VIEWFLOW`. Includes a `reload_settings` function to update settings dynamically.
* **`fields.py`**: Defines a custom `CompositeKey` field that acts as a composite primary key, handling JSON serialization/deserialization and overriding the delete method.  Includes a custom `Exact` lookup class for efficient querying.
* **`jsonstore.py`**: Implements a custom JSON field storage mechanism for Django models, handling various data types and providing custom field types (BooleanField, CharField, etc.) that integrate with JSON storage. Uses `JSONFieldDescriptor` for accessing and modifying JSON field data.
* **`middleware.py`**: Defines `SiteMiddleware` (sets site and app attributes on request, handling permissions) and `HotwireTurboMiddleware` (modifies HTTP response codes for Turbo requests).
* **`this_object.py`**: Provides helper classes (`ThisMethod`, `ThisObject`, `This`) for creating forward references to class attributes and methods, enabling referencing class members before definition (useful for workflow/state machine implementations).  A global `this` object is instantiated for use in class definitions.

## Subdirectory Details

### `assets/`

This directory contains static assets used by the application.  Files include images (`*.png`, `*.svg`, `*.gif`) for various UI elements.

### `demo/`

This directory likely contains a sample application demonstrating the use of the Viewflow backend.  Further investigation is needed to determine the exact functionality.
